USAGE: BITSADMIN [/RAWRETURN] [/WRAP | /NOWRAP] command
The following commands are available:

/HELP                                    Prints this help
/?                                       Prints this help
/UTIL /?                                 Prints the list of utilities commands
/LIST    [/ALLUSERS] [/VERBOSE]          List the jobs
/MONITOR [/ALLUSERS] [/REFRESH sec]      Monitors the copy manager
/RESET   [/ALLUSERS]                     Deletes all jobs in the manager

/TRANSFER name [type] [/PRIORITY priority] [/ACLFLAGS flags]
          remote_url local_name
    Transfers one of more files.
    [type] may be /DOWNLOAD or /UPLOAD; default is download
    Multiple URL/file pairs may be specified.

/CREATE [type] display_name              Creates a job
    [type] may be /DOWNLOAD, /UPLOAD, or /UPLOAD-REPLY; default is download

/INFO job [/VERBOSE]               Displays information about the job
/ADDFILE job remote_url local_name Adds a file to the job
/ADDFILESET job textfile           Adds multiple files to the job
   Each line of <textfile> lists a file's remote name and local name, separated
   by spaces.  A line beginning with '#' is treated as a comment.
   Once the file set is read into memory, the contents are added to the job.

/ADDFILEWITHRANGES  job  remote_url local_name range_list
   Like /ADDFILE, but BITS will read only selected byte ranges of the URL.
   range_list is a comma-delimited series of offset and length pairs.
   For example,

       0:100,2000:100,5000:eof

   instructs BITS to read 100 bytes starting at offset zero, 100 bytes starting
   at offset 2000, and the remainder of the URL starting at offset 5000.

/REPLACEREMOTEPREFIX job  old_prefix new_prefix
    All files whose URL begins with <old_prefix> are changed to use <new_prefix>

/LISTFILES job                     Lists the files in the job

               first parameter.

  Examples:
    bitsadmin /SetNotifyCmdLine MyJob c:\winnt\system32\notepad.exe  NULL
    bitsadmin /SetNotifyCmdLine MyJob c:\foo.exe "c:\foo.exe parm1 parm2"

  <scheme> may be BASIC, DIGEST, NTLM, NEGOTIATE, or PASSPORT.

/REMOVECREDENTIALS job <target> <scheme>
  Removes credentials from a job.

The following options are valid for UPLOAD-REPLY jobs only:

/GETREPLYFILENAME job      Gets the path of the file containing the server reply
/SETREPLYFILENAME job path Sets the path of the file containing the server reply
/GETREPLYPROGRESS job      Gets the size and progress of the server reply
/GETREPLYDATA     job      Dumps the server's reply data in hex format

The following options can be placed before the command:
/RAWRETURN                         Return data more suitable for parsing
/WRAP                              Wrap output around console (default)
/NOWRAP                            Don't wrap output around console

The /RAWRETURN option strips new line characters and formatting.
It is recognized by the /CREATE and /GET* commands.

Commands that take a job parameter will accept either a job name or a job-ID
GUID inside braces.  BITSADMIN reports an error if a name is ambiguous.
